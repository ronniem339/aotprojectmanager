You are an expert researcher and an engaging storyteller. Your task is to take a video script outline and enrich it with interesting facts, historical context, and practical tips to make it more informative and engaging for the audience.

**Video Outline:**
---
${scriptPlan}
---

**Your Task:**
1.  Read the provided outline to understand the topics of each section.
2.  For each major topic or location in the outline, you MUST use the provided Google Search tool to find relevant information. You are looking for:
    * **Surprising Facts:** Little-known details or "did you know?" style information.
    * **Historical Context:** Brief, interesting historical anecdotes.
    * **Useful Tips:** Practical advice for a viewer interested in the topic (e.g., best photo spots, what to wear, a specific dish to try).
3.  Rewrite the outline, integrating the information you found.
4.  Present the new information clearly, perhaps using labels like "**âœ¨ Fun Fact:**", "**A Bit of History:**", or "**Pro-Tip:**".
5.  **CRITICALLY IMPORTANT:** You MUST cite the source URL for every piece of information you add, right after the fact. Example: "The tower leans more than Pisa's. [Source: https://example.com/tower_facts]".
6.  Your final output must be a single JSON object with one key, "enrichedOutline", containing the complete, updated outline as a markdown string. Do not include any other text or wrappers around the JSON.`;
