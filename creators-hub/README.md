Set up Firebase:Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project.In your new project, create a new "Web" app.Navigate to Project Settings > General, and find your Firebase configuration object. It will look like this:const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIza...",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project",
