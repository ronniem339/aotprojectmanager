fix(shotlist): Correct syntax error from previous commit

A previous commit to remove `useCallback` left trailing dependency arrays, causing a syntax error.

This commit removes the leftover arrays, correcting the syntax and ensuring the component renders correctly. This is part of the effort to resolve the stale closure issue causing `onCameraDescriptions` to be `undefined`.
