fix(scripting): Ensure parsed transcript data is accessible for script generation

- Modified `handleGenerateFullScript` to directly use `currentTaskData.onCameraDescriptions` when the `onCameraInputMode` is 'transcript'.
- This resolves the `ReferenceError: parsedTranscript is not defined` that occurred when attempting to generate the full script after reopening the modal at the `review_parsed_transcript` stage, as `parsedTranscript` (a state variable) was not reliably re-initialized, but `onCameraDescriptions` (a property of `localTaskData`) is correctly persisted and reloaded.
