fix(scripting): Preserve on-camera notes input

The `LocationDetailsCard` component was using its own internal state for the on-camera notes, which caused the input to be cleared on re-renders.

This commit refactors the component to remove the internal state and use the main application state directly, ensuring that the notes are preserved as the user types.
