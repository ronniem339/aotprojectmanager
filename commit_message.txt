fix(shotlist): Correct syntax from previous commits

Previous commits introduced syntax errors by incorrectly removing `useCallback` hooks. This commit corrects the function definitions for `generateShotListFromExistingScript` and `generateAndSaveShotList`, resolving the parsing errors.

This is the third attempt to fix the underlying stale closure issue, and this commit focuses solely on correcting the syntax to get the component rendering again.
