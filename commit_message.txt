fix(scripting): Load parseTranscriptAI script

The `parseTranscriptAI.js` file was not being loaded in `index.html`, which caused a "function not found" error when trying to use the full transcript feature.

This commit adds the necessary script tag to `index.html` to ensure the `parseTranscriptAI` function is available to the application.
