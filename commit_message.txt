feat(scripting): Add full transcript input for on-camera notes

This commit introduces a new workflow for providing on-camera dialogue during the scripting process. Users can now choose between two modes:

1.  **Notes per Location (Existing):** The original method of adding notes for each on-camera location individually.
2.  **Full Transcript (New):** A new option to paste a complete on-camera transcript.

When the full transcript option is used, a new AI utility (`parseTranscriptAI.js`) analyzes the text, cleans it up by removing filler words, and automatically assigns dialogue segments to the most likely on-camera location.

A new "Review Transcript" step has been added to the scripting workspace, allowing users to review and correct the AI's parsing before the final script is generated. This provides a more flexible and streamlined experience for users who prefer to write their on-camera dialogue in a single document.
