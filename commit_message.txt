fix(shotlist): Definitive fix for stale closure issue

This commit resolves the long-standing bug where `onCameraDescriptions` was `undefined` during shot list generation.

The root cause was a stale closure created by the `useCallback` hook, which prevented the component from receiving the updated `video` prop.

This commit definitively fixes the issue by:
1. Removing the `useCallback` hook from the generation functions.
2. Removing the `useCallback` import.
3. Correcting all syntax errors introduced in previous attempts.

This ensures the component always uses the latest props, preventing stale data and resolving the bug correctly.
