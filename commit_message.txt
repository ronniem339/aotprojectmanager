fix(shotlist): Remove useCallback to prevent stale closures

The `useCallback` hook was causing the `generateShotListFromExistingScript` and `generateAndSaveShotList` functions to retain a stale version of the `video` prop, where `onCameraDescriptions` was `undefined`.

This commit removes the `useCallback` wrapper from these functions. This ensures that the functions are recreated on every render, guaranteeing they always have access to the latest `video` prop and preventing the stale closure issue. This resolves the bug where `onCameraDescriptions` was being passed as `undefined` to the AI generation function.
