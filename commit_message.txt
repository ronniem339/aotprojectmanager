fix(ai): Improve transcript parsing and model selection

- **Model Selection:** Switched `parseTranscriptAI` to use the `gemini-pro` model (by setting `isComplex: true`) for more accurate and reliable transcript analysis, as it's a complex task requiring nuanced understanding and structured output.
- **JSON Parsing Error:** Removed redundant `JSON.parse()` call in `parseTranscriptAI.js`. The `callGeminiAPI` function already handles JSON parsing when `response_mime_type` is set, leading to a `SyntaxError` when `JSON.parse()` was called on an already-parsed JavaScript object.
