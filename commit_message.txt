fix(scripting): Correctly format onCameraDescriptions for script generation

- Transformed `onCameraDescriptions` from an object with arrays of dialogue segments to an object with single string values (by joining the arrays with newlines) when using the full transcript input mode.
- This resolves the `TypeError: desc.trim is not a function` error in `generateFinalScriptAI.js`, as it now receives the expected string format for on-camera descriptions.
