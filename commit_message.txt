fix(scripting): Persist scripting stage after transcript parsing

- Ensured that the `scriptingStage` is explicitly updated to `review_parsed_transcript` after the successful parsing of the full transcript.
- This resolves the issue where the scripting workspace would revert to the initial input screen instead of the review stage upon reopening, requiring the user to re-parse the transcript.
